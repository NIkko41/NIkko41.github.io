## Theme

For my new page, I would like to use the theme Daktilo I want to use this theme because it is simple, and pleasing to the eye. 

![Daktilo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Maynard-Schools/jekyll-setup-NIkko41/master/assets/img/Screenshot%202018-12-10%20at%2010.03.47%20AM.png)

## New Page

I would make a page for questions and answers. This page will allow for visitors to ask any questions they have, and for the host to answer them to the best of their ability. This would be helpful not just for the people asking the questions, but also for the people who see the page, people will see the questions and answers, and answer their own questions from  them.

## New Feature

My new feature would be to be able to have visitors on my site ask questions. This would go on my Questions and Answers page, and allow visitors to type questions that pop up on the site. I would be able to answer their questions by typing a response and posting it on the page.
